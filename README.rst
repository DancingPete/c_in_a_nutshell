Overview
========

This project functions as a notetaking sandbox for studying the C 
programming language.
Specifically, the project is a summarization of the content of 
*C in a Nutshell* by Peter Prinz and Tony Crawford.

There will be some deviations from the example scripts; notably, 
simple formatting preferences, as well as some scaffolding suggestions
made by Klemens in *21st Century C*.
